-> make html and css boiler plate 
-> make a main div (height 100%, width 100%)
-> make another panel div inside the main div, -> make this center using display flex in main div, make overflow hidden so that anything goes out of it will be hidden
-> make another div inside the panel at the top of the panel div
-> make three boxes inside the ptop(panel at the top of panel), make panel top display flex
-> make the three boxes go side by side with some space between them
-> name the three boxes Hit, Timer and Score
-> make the bottom panel 
-> set width 100% and height calc(100% - 100px)
-> make a bubble of size about 60px, border-radius 50%, make it disply - flex, justify-content - center, align-items - center
-> give hover effect to make the color darker when hovered on it and change the cursor type to pointer
-> make the display of bottom panel flex
-> when many elements are made though then can't be stored in a line still they are squeezed in, to remove this we need to use flex-wrap - wrap

--> now we need javascript to make more bubbles
-> create a loop which creates bubbles some n number of times, save it in a string
-> using DOM (.innerHTML) write the clutter
-> now we need to change the number for each of the bubble, using Math.random() function
-> put the bubble making code in a function

-> creating the timer
create a variable timer, set its value to 60 at the start
make a function which changes the timer value using the setInterval function
change the textcontent of the timer using DOM
now we have to make sure that the timer does not go beyond 0

-> changing the value of hit everytime we refresh
it is similar to that done above, we need to change the text content of the hit box

--> Game Rules: within the timer when we hit the bubble with the same number as hit, the score adds up and the hit and bubbles are refreshed

-> Event Bubbling
jispe click karoge woh element par event raise hoga, aaur event listener na milne par event element ke parent par listener dhundega 

-> Now we need to write the code to increase the score
we need to add event listener to bottom panel and use details.target to get on which bubble event is raised.
change the type to number to add to score using Number() function
